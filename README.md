# My-Movie-List-01
This is a movie based web application.
The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search option where they can search movies and see details of those movies. 
They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ). On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.
These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only the person who created can see this list )



## How to run this project ##
